Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.

Change the csv file name to the csv file you wish to analyze

Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented.

It will be output to the console, but it could be connected to an output file, if implementation is added for that

UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand
